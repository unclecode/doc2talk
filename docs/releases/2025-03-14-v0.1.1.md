# Release 0.1.1

I am excited to announce the release of version 0.1.1 of Doc2Talk! This is the very first version. This built for Crawl4ai at firstm but thne I found it really helpful, I separate it as an standalone library for you beautiful people. This update brings significant improvements to our core functionality, adds new features to enhance user experience, and fixes various issues to provide a more stable tool for chatting with code documentation.

## Major Features and Improvements

- **Custom LLM Configurations**: Users can now define custom configurations for the language model, allowing for more tailored responses based on specific documentation needs.
  
- **Lazy Initialization**: Both the core module and the Doc2Talk API now support lazy initialization, improving the efficiency of loading resources only when necessary.

- **Core Chat Functionality**: A new chat interface has been implemented, enabling users to interact directly with the documentation through a command-line interface (CLI).

- **Doc2Talk Facade Class**: A new facade class has been introduced in the API, providing a simplified way to interact with the Doc2Talk features.

## Bug Fixes

- **Source Validation**: Fixed an issue in the `build_index` method where source validation was not functioning as intended, ensuring that only valid sources are processed.

## Breaking Changes

- No breaking changes were introduced in this release.
